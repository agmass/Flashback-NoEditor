For use with VulkanMod. Does not include any of the editor features (or the library that the editor depends on; ImGui; which crashes VulkanMod); however you can still attempt to open the editor screen (which will crash the game)

Bobby and Dynamic FPS seem to be incompatible with this from my testing
